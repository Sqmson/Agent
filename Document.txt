                    Request a Service

First and foremost, I would like to thank the appointing authority, HE the President of Uganda, the Cabinet Minister, State Minister & Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of ICT & National Guidance and the Board of NITA-U for entrusting me with the responsibility to steer NITA-U at the helm. I would also like to thank the staff at NITA Uganda and the Ministry of ICT&NG for the warm welcome you have given me.  I look forward to working closely with you as we continue to deliver on our mandate.

As we all know, NITA-U is at the forefront of transforming the livelihood and well-being of Ugandans through the use of ICT to enhance the delivery of public services to our citizens. This is in line with our strategic mandate to have all Government service delivered online. We plan to achieve this task by making a breakthrough in the ways we deliver this mandate.Over the next five (5) years, we will consolidate and focus our synergies in rolling out the National Data Transmission Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) to all the one hundred and thirty-four (134) Districts across the country and target connectivity more than 50% of the planned 20,000 connection sites at the District and sub-county levels.As a regulator for ICT in the Country, NITA-U will provide support to strengthen the ICT sector through harmonization of the laws, regulations, policies, standards and frameworks to create an enabling environment that will enhance and foster the adoption of online services in Uganda.We plan to enhance the implementation of the National Information Security Framework (NISF) to protect our critical Information Infrastructure against any potential cyber threats. This will be achieved by enhancing our National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) as well as strengthening our local, regional and international collaborations on Information Security matters.To enhance our IT Research and Innovation over the next five (5) years, specific emphasis and efforts will be channelled to the establishment of a National IT Park. This, we believe, will boost research in homegrown ICT solutions that will facilitate and drive the digital transformation agenda. In summary, we will focus our effort in fast-tracking the extension of connectivity across the country and digitization of the Government of Uganda (GOU) services in order to transform the lives of our citizens. We will strive to build a high-speed National Backbone Infrastructure and adopt advancement in fibre optics technology. In view of this, NITA-U will integrate IT Security, Data Processing and e-Government Frameworks with the Backbone to achieve affordable and accessible IT services for the Government of Uganda.As I take over the leadership of NITA-U today, I have confidence in the vibrant NITA-U team that I will be leading and appreciate the achievements of my predecessor. We will strive to build on these successes for the good of the ICT sector and our country Uganda.I take this opportunity to extend my sincere appreciation to our stakeholders, development partners & MDA/LGs and once again, thank the appointing authority for his trust in me to steer henceforth.FOR GOD AND MY COUNTRY

The NITA-U Strategic Plan 2020/21-2024/25 provides a paradigm shift in the way NITA-U will provide services to Government. The implementation of the strategy is expected to be delivered through implementation of 5-year National Development Plan (NDPIII) with first two years already implemented. The strategic plan through the Digital Transformation Programme provides strategies to develop digital infrastructure, digital skills, digital innovations, close access and usage gaps and encourage digitization across the entire economy.

Satisfaction of the NITA-U customer who is an MDA/LGs/Government service delivery unit or citizen comes first and everything else is driven towards that goal. The process of delivering value to the customer has been clearly defined and the right resources have been aligned through the IT Service Delivery Model and guided by NPDIII.

The Strategy has been informed by stakeholder expectations of NITA-U as stipulated in the Digital Transformation Programme in order to contribute to attainment of the National development priorities in Uganda’s vision 2040 as well as emerging issues within the ICT global arena. To this end, the new strategic agenda focuses on three strategic pillars for the next five years i.e. Service delivery excellence, Operational excellence and relationship excellence.

The strategic objectives will be pursued across the three priority areas resulting in a number of outcomes such as a complete transformation in public service delivery, increased access to ICT by all regions especially the underserved regions, reduction in the cost of internet bandwidth and Government savings through rationalization of ICT services.

With our co-location service we offer the rental of physical space, including rack cabinets or floor space, to house an organization's servers, IT equipment, and networking hardware. This provides a strategic advantage by allowing businesses or organisations to leverage specialized facilities and infrastructure without the need for extensive investments in building and maintaining their data centers.

By opting for colocation, companies can significantly reduce costs associated with constructing and managing a dedicated data center. It also helps mitigate operational risks, as we typically offer advanced security, redundant power systems, and climate control, ensuring the optimal performance and protection of critical IT assets. Our colocation service comes with great key features including

99.99% Uptime SLA: We typically offer a Service Level Agreement (SLA) guaranteeing a 99.99% uptime, ensuring that your equipment remains operational and accessible to users nearly 100% of the time.

Hot Aisle Containment: We have the hot aisle containment which a cooling strategy that isolates and contains the hot air exhaust from servers and equipment, preventing it from mixing with the cool supply air. This approach improves cooling efficiency and equipment performance.

Cold Aisle Containment: We also have the cold aisle containment complements hot aisle containment by ensuring that cold air is directed precisely to where it's needed, reducing energy waste and maintaining consistent temperatures.

Power: We provide reliable power sources with backup generators to ensure continuous operations even during power outages.

Cooling: We have advanced cooling solutions  to maintain an optimal temperature for equipment, preventing overheating and ensuring peak performance, plus In-row cooling where systems are strategically placed within server rows to deliver efficient and targeted cooling to specific areas, preventing hot spots and ensuring uniform temperature distribution

The traditional reliance on passwords and passcodes is now braced with security challenges as well as end user fatigue given the increasing trend of digital services. As a result, user identities cannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt.

Whereas it is estimated that the introduction of online services by GoU has simplified access to services and saved over four million working hours, users still have to physically go to GoU offices to sign documents in order to complete some of the more complex transactions. This has proved to be a huddle to the rollout and adoption of e-services, that otherwise would be in high demand.

There is a need to for a secure channel for identification of users as well as the use of advanced electronic signatures based on a chain of trust.

1.    Internet Bandwidth and Leased Line Services

Under the Strategy for Rationalisation of IT services across Government MDAs, NITA-U providing is currently providing bulk Internet Bandwidth to Government through the National Data Transmission Backbone Infrastructure (NBI).

The overall objective of the bulk purchase of internet bandwidth by NITA – U is to:

(i) Reduce the cost of internet bandwidth through the economies of scale realised through the bulk purchase of bandwidth.

(ii) Enable NITA – U rollout e-Government services like (online education, and health etc.) that are dependent on the accessibility of high speed internet services

(iii) Connect MDAs and Special Interest Groups onto the NBI/EGI for delivery of internet services

(iv) Promote the BPO industry across the country through the delivery of cheap internet bandwidth in all the towns that will be covered by the NBI.

The provision of Internet to MDAs through the backbone commenced in FY2013/14 and at the time, the market price for One (1) Megabits per second (Mbps) of Internet Bandwidth per month was on average USD 700.

However, the provision of Bulk Internet through the National Data Transmission Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) has seen the reduction of Internet bandwidth cost from $190Mbps per month $70 per Mbps to  as provided in table 1 below.

NITA – U currently offers one of the lowest prices for Internet and intends to reduce this cost further which will in turn lower the Bandwidth prices across the country.

In addition to that, NITA-U is providing Leased line services (Dedicated data links) at USD 150 which is still within the average the market rates. NITA-U through one of its partners Soliton Telmac offers a 24*7 monitoring and fist line support NOC (Network Operating Centre).

2.    Hosting and Co-location in National Data Centre

The National Data Centre is fully equipped with state of the art technology and the functionalities provided in table 1 below.

Multiple layers of hardened physical security.

Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance

Instant SMS Alerts to predefined personnel

Biometric access and code protected entry

Access to data center only by designated and authorized staff

Fully Redundant, Data Grade Power and Air Conditioning

Two generators one with 200KVA backup and other 250KVA back up with 2-day fuel

Fully redundant precision controlled air condition environment

Monitoring of Virtualized infrastructure to host production site for applications and databases

Provision of required infrastructure to host production site such as CPU, RAM and storage.

Provision of required platform to host production sites and DR sites.

Dedicated Virtual Servers with required specifications

Dedicated Virtualized storage system for customer Data.

Dedicated platform for customer requirements.

One of the key intervention under the Strategy for Rationalisation of IT Services across MDAs is the provision of centralised Data Centre hosting and Disaster Recovery Services.

Currently NITA-U is providing Data Centre services (Platform As A Service(PAAS), Infrastructure As A Service(IAAS),Software As A Service(SAAS), Disaster Recovery As A Service and Backup AS A Service(BAAS)).

Costing for Data Centre Services is calculated based on several factors such as cost of power for the equipment, cost of cooling, vendor support, licensing and other administrative costs.  Prices vary based on user requirements.

As Uganda moves in to the e-government era, there is need to secure transfer of information for citizens, public and private sectors. NITA-U had put in place the Information security framework to provide Government with the necessary process, policies, standards and guideline to help in Information Assurance.

Furthermore NITA through various stakeholders has operationalized the National Information Security Advisory Group (NISAG) to advice on Information Security Governance, Risk Remediation Planning and Response.
Incident Monitoring and management

With the rampant cybercrimes, the National CERT has been established to serve the government of a Uganda by helping to protect the critical information infrastructure. The National CERT plays a key role in coordinating incident management with the relevant stakeholders at national level.  You can report an incident on https://www.cert.ug/
Report Abuse

NITA-U in collaboration with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) put in place the ‘Child Sexual Abuse Reporting Page’-OSCARP www.report.nita.go.ug  an online mechanism where citizens in Uganda can report online child sexual abuse material. The portal will be able to support tracing and take down of harmful content, rescue of victims as well as assist in investigations to prosecute cyber criminals.

As Uganda moves in to the e-government era, there is need to secure transfer of information for citizens, public and private sectors. NITA-U had put in place the Information security framework to provide Government with the necessary process, policies, standards and guideline to help in Information Assurance.

Furthermore NITA through various stakeholders has operationalized the National Information Security Advisory Group (NISAG) to advice on Information Security Governance, Risk Remediation Planning and Response.

With the rampant cybercrimes, the National CERT has been established to serve the government of a Uganda by helping to protect the critical information infrastructure. The National CERT plays a key role in coordinating incident management with the relevant stakeholders at national level.  You can report an incident on https://www.cert.ug/

NITA-U in collaboration with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) put in place the ‘Child Sexual Abuse Reporting Page’-OSCARP www.report.nita.go.ug  an online mechanism where citizens in Uganda can report online child sexual abuse material. The portal will be able to support tracing and take down of harmful content, rescue of victims as well as assist in investigations to prosecute cyber criminals.

One of the services being provided by the National Information Technology Authority-Uganda (NITA-U) to the Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and Local Governments (LGs) is Bulk Software Licensing.The provision of bulk software Licensing is based on the Fifth Strategy for Rationalization of Information Technology (IT) Services which was approved by Cabinet in 2012.

CURRENT STATUSNITA-U, acting on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Uganda, in line with the Fifth Strategy for Rationalization of I.T Services in Government has negotiated Global Agreements with Multinational Software Companies namely;

In 2013, the NITA-U through an Enterprise Direct Advisor (EDA) carried out a comprehensive assessment of software licensing state and utilization across Government Ministries Department and Agencies (MDAs). The objective of the assessment were:

(i)    To determine Government of Uganda licensing expenditure

(ii)   To determine the number of MDAs that were engaged with Microsoft

(iii)  To provide the quantities of licenses consumed per year

(iv)  To provide cost saving that will arise from the consolidation of the disparate licenses

The assessments identified the following key challenges that were inherent in the management of Software licensing and Application for the Government of Uganda and needed to be addressed.

(i)   High government expenditure on software licenses due to retail purchases

(ii)  Minimal manufacturers’ after-sale services (i.e. Premium services and software assurance benefits.)

(iii) Poor management of software licenses i.e. poor monitoring and interpretation of license terms and conditions

(iv) Rampant Software and applications piracy – Expensive if legal proceedings are opened against offenders.

(v)  Low exploration and exploitation of the benefits of free open source software

In light of the above, NITA-U negotiated and signed the Microsoft Business and Services Agreement (MBSA) with Microsoft to provide bulk licensing of Software and Application for Government Institutions

The NITA-U on behalf of Government of Uganda has completed the negotiations and signing of an agreement with Oracle Corporation to provide bulk licensing of Oracle Software and Systems for Government Institutions. The Oracle software once acquired, will be owned perpetually by the Government and only attract an annual support fee of 22% per unit.

The discounted prices were negotiated after NITA-U carried out a survey in 2012 to all the 12 MDAs that use Oracle and discovered that Government was paying over USD31m per year.

Discounted product prices due to economies of scale arising from bulk purchase. The baseline discount on Oracle Products is at 40%

Discounted support costs due to economies of scale arising from bulk purchase. The baseline discount on Oracle support is at 22%

Harmonized prices across Government for selected Software Products.

PROCESS OF ONBOARDING MDAs ONTO THE MASTER BUSINESS AND SERVICES AGREEMENT (MBSA)

MDA requests for Microsoft Software Licenses

NITA-U shares a quotation with the MDA in line with the requirements in (1) above

Upon approval of the Quotation, an MOU between NITA-U and the MDA is drafted and dispatched to the MDA for signature.

Once the MOU is signed by the MDA and returned to NITA-U Headquarters, NITA-U in turn appends a their signature.

A copy of the signed MOU, Software Product(s), License Keys and the Invoice are sent to the MDA

3.    If the MDA has at least 250 Users, the MDA contacts Microsoft but uses the negotiated prices as a baseline for further negotiation* if any.

*Important to note here is the fact that NITA-U has already negotiated the Global Agreement, therefore MDAs will not be entering into new Enterprise Agreements but rather Enterprise Subscription Enrollment Agreements that are specific to the MDA requirements.

Kindly contact NITA-U in case further clarification is required.

"Lives transformed through e-services delivery"

There is no universally applicable definition. However, it can be said that a pandemic is the increased and sustained propagation of an extraordinary infectious human disease that rapidly affects all parts of the world and a large part of the global population

SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that had not been seen in humans before. The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, capital of the Hubei province. At first, the epidemic seemed to be linked to the South China Seafood City market. This market hosts merchants for seafood, poultry, bats, marmots and other wild animals, which indicates a probable animal origin of this virus. The virus was later confirmed to also transmit between humans. Cases have since been discovered in other regions of China and in other countries, often linked to a previous visit of Wuhan. The health authorities of the various affected countries are currently investigating this new coronavirus and the sources of the contamination.

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause symptoms ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses, i.e. the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The new coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that had not yet been identified in humans. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the latest discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 infection remains mild in 80% of cases. In order to delay spreading among the general population and to protect vulnerable and fragile groups in the population, it is important to take a certain number of precautions.

The NBI is reliable and has redundancy therefore will meet Wi-Fi needs 100%

We intend to offer reliable service of up to 99.7% availability

We shall be achieving maximum speeds up to 2mbps. Free Wi-Fi is a best-effort service intended to give basic access to the internet.

As NITA-U, we implemented industry standard security controls and measures in order to provide a safe and secure service

The provision of services is the primary responsibility of Government complimented by the private sector for various reasons. If you take the health sector as an example, you cannot say Mulago is competing with IHK, rather that they complement each other.

We are rolling out the service based on our current footprint of the national backbone. More areas will be connected within the next Financial Year

Regional Communications Infrastructure Program(RCIP)

The Government of Uganda secured funding in the amount of US$ 75 Million Equivalent IDA – World Bank for the financing of the Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (RCIP)  – Uganda Project.  Uganda becomes the 8th African Country to benefit from this initiative which aims to help address the regions connectivity constraints.  Other countries that have already benefited from the initiative include: Kenya, Burundi, Madagascar, Rwanda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi and Comoros.

A regional approach will help to mitigate the impact for landlocked countries which must rely on transiting traffic through neighbouring countries; and enhance the viability of infrastructure increasing volume of traffic leading to reducing prices and improving regional affordability of broadband.

RCIP will support the Government of Uganda in improving: (i) coverage for IT infrastructure in the country; (ii) the delivery of public services by improving efficiency through government cloud infrastructure (iii) Integration of Government IT systems (iv) building capacity in management of IT programs and projects; (v) improve policy and regulatory environment for ICT in country.

RCIP Uganda will complement existing ICT initiatives in the country, including the National Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) and private sector investment by helping to bridge the financing and technical gaps. RCIP Uganda project aims to transform public service delivery using Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to improve the lives of Ugandans.

The 6 year programme was designed, approved and became effective on 26th May, 2016.

The development objectives of the proposed RCIP Uganda project are consistent with objectives of the RCIP Program as a whole, namely to support the Government’s efforts to:

Lower prices for international capacity and extend the geographic reach of broadband networks (the connectivity development objective); and

Improve the Government’s efficiency and transparency through e-Government applications (the transparency development objective).

It is anticipated that at the end of its implementation, the following direct benefits will accrue to Government and citizens of Uganda

Increase in ICT sector investment and competitiveness, and improved access to quality of ICT services for citizens, businesses, and government resulting from a conducive enabling environment

Improve in productivity and service delivery across all sectors, both public and private as a result of shared services

Employment - stimulate job creation in new areas where it is extended (northern and western Uganda) through the construction and operation of networks and, importantly, by boosting entrepreneurship and self-employment

Growth in the number of internet users, more intensive use of information-rich services with lower unit prices and greater choice

Growth in locally-relevant content and applications due to faster, cheaper and more accessible platform

Financial savings from not having to build duplicate infrastructure at individual MDAs as a result of shared public service delivery platform

Faster and cheaper implementation of e-Government services in various sectors from not having to build duplicate infrastructure at individual MDAs

Improve in transparency and efficiency of procedures and practices supported by e-Government services

New Services (e.g., mobile money and mobile banking or others) are likely to emerge or become more widely available to society

Business Process Outsourcing - IT Enabled Services

The ITES-BPO Framework and Roadmap for Uganda. Uganda has developed a robust ITES-BPO framework that comprises of three key elements – The Governance Group, the Implementation Roadmap and the Monitoring and Evaluation framework as described in the figure below.

Establishment of a 240-seater BPO Incubation Centre on the 4th floor of Statistics House in Kampala. It is currently being run by a private sector company, Techno Brain Uganda Limited, employing a total of 240 agents. Indirect employment has also been created in the various sectors of the economy e.g. through provision of food, security, transport, cleaning services, accommodation, etc.

A total of 500 graduates were trained in BPO; some of them have been absorbed in the BPO/ITES Sector. Some of these have now been promoted as supervisors, replacing foreign nationals who were employed at the start of operations at the Incubation Centre.

NITA facilitated the creation of the Uganda BPO Association which currently has 48 registered companies, employing over 4000 Ugandans. Employment in the sector grew by about 30% over the last one year.

NITA-U partnered with the Uganda BPO Association to organize regional BPO conference and exhibition in Uganda in September 2012 and September 2013. This year’s conference was covered widely by both electronic and print media. The Conference will be an annual event for promoting the BPO/ITES sector in Uganda.

Partnership with Internet Now Project at Gulu University, funded by Oxfam, which is currently employing about 210 agents in Northern Uganda. This is an indication that BPO can thrive outside Kampala.

BPO pilot training was successfully conducted from March to April 2013 under the Joint protocol between the Government of Uganda and Arab Republic of Egypt. This will be followed by the training of trainers of at least 25 instructors this FY. It will be facilitated by the Egyptian Government;

Egyptian Experts conducted an In-house training for NITA staff in November 2013 for management of the BPO ToT Programme;

NITA provided technical support to the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development and the Uganda Child Rights Network NGO (UCRNN) towards the procurement of a Child Helpline System that has been set up at the BPO Incubation Centre. This is a call centre system for the protection of vulnerable children from abuse and neglect.

The BPO/ITES Strategy and Model for Uganda has been reviewed and updated;

Incentives Guidelines for supporting the BPO/ITES industry has been developed;

BPO Standards, Regulations and Accreditation Guidelines has been developed;
